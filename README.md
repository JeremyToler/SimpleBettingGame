# SimpleBettingGame
Made in 2014 to test my ability to script. This is the first game I ever made and the first code/project I ever made without following a tutorial.  

I had challanged 2 friends to a contest, we were each to learn to code and make a game using any tools we wanted. 
I decided to learn C because all the popular languages are C based. I assumed I would lose this challange for not deciding to use a game engine
but my friends both did not end up finishing a game by the deadline so I won by default :)
